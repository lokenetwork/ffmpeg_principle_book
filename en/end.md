First of all, I would like to thank my family for their support, which has given me ample time to write. I also want to express my gratitude to all readers for their recognition of this book, including praise, monetary rewards, and content proofreading.

Although the first edition of "FFmpeg Principle" is completed, I am currently working on several other books. Your attention is welcome.

1. "Principle of JPEG," which explains the encoding and decoding implementation of the libjpeg open-source project.
2. "Principle of udt," analyzing the code of udt and how to implement a reliable transmission protocol based on UDP.
3. "[Principle of SRS](https://srs.xianwaizhiyin.net/)," analyzing the code of SRS, already available.
4. "Principle of ZLMediaKit," analyzing the code of ZLMediaKit.
