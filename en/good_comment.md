In terms of content, there is no other book like this on the market. I usually read it on the subway, trying to catch up with the author's progress by the end of the year. I hope it will be published soon. Luo Ge is an inspiration, and I hope I can maintain the same passion for learning and technology at his age. Sharing individuals like Luo Ge are truly encouraging.
