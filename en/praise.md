In terms of content, there is no other book like this on the market. I usually read it on the subway, trying to catch up with the author's progress by the end of the year. I hope it will be published soon. Luo Ge is an inspiration, and I hope I can maintain the same passion for learning and technology at his age. Sharing individuals like Luo Ge are truly encouraging.

When I was preparing for the autumn recruitment season, I spent more than a month learning the code step-by-step with Luo Ge's "FFmpeg Principle." During this time, Luo Ge provided a lot of help, and I also received offers that I was quite satisfied with. Luo Ge's "FFmpeg Principle" is truly worth everyone's time to study!

Luo Laoshi's analysis of the FFmpeg code is very detailed. I am currently studying the internal implementation of the FFmpeg transcoder and have learned a lot.

Luo Laoshi's book provides a very detailed analysis of the API and can be used as a reference book. It's much easier to understand than just reading the source code. Kudos, Luo Laoshi! Keep up the good work, and I look forward to the physical book.
